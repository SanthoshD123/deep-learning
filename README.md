# Deep Learning

A repository containing implementations of neural network architectures.

## Contents

This repository contains:

- **artificial_neural_network.py**: Implementation of a basic artificial neural network
- **convolutional_neural_network.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with implementation and examples of convolutional neural networks

## Usage

The code in this repository demonstrates basic neural network architectures and can be used for educational purposes or as a starting point for your own deep learning projects.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- TensorFlow/Keras (for running the neural network implementations)
- Jupyter (for running the notebooks)

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and explore the implementations:

```
git clone https://github.com/SanthoshD123/deep-learning.git
cd deep-learning
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to add more neural network architectures or improve the existing ones.
